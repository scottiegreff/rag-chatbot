This is a test document for frontend upload functionality.

The purpose of this document is to test whether the frontend file upload interface correctly:
1. Accepts .txt files
2. Shows upload progress
3. Sends the file to the backend API
4. Processes it into the vector database
5. Makes the content available for questions

If this works correctly, you should be able to ask questions about this document after uploading it through the web interface.
