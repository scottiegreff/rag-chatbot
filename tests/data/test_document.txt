Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include:

1. Speech recognition
2. Learning
3. Planning
4. Problem solving

Machine learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze various factors of data. These neural networks are designed to mimic the human brain's structure and function, allowing them to process data in a way that's similar to how humans think and learn.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is another important area of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.

Computer vision is the field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects and then react to what they "see."
