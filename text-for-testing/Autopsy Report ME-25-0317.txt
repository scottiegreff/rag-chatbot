Hair Color: Dark Brown (graying at temples)

Date of Death: Presumed July 23, 2025

Place of Death: 1186 W. Cordova Street, Apartment 1803, Vancouver, BC

Identified by: Dental Records and Fingerprint Analysis

Circumstances: Subject found deceased in apartment under suspicious circumstances; last seen alive by neighbor at 6:45 PM on July 22, 2025.

External Examination
The decedent is a well-nourished, well-developed Caucasian male appearing consistent with the stated age of 42 years. Rigor mortis is fully developed in all four extremities and jaw. Livor mortis is fixed on the posterior aspect of the body, indicating the decedent was supine for a prolonged period. The body is cool to the touch, consistent with being dead for 36–48 hours.

No external resuscitative efforts (e.g., defibrillator pad marks, rib fractures) are noted. There are no signs of recent trauma or assault except as described below:

Head and Neck:
A 3.2 cm linear contusion is noted on the left temporal region, consistent with blunt force trauma. No skull depression palpable.
A faint ligature mark is present on the anterior neck, horizontally oriented, measuring 0.8 cm in width, suggesting compression with a soft, broad object.

Torso:
Abrasions consistent with a fall are present on the right scapular ridge and left elbow.
No defensive wounds are observed on hands or forearms.

Limbs:
Fingernails are intact; nail beds show no signs of hemorrhage. Subungual scraping collected for toxicological analysis.
Petechiae observed in bilateral conjunctivae.

Internal Examination
Cranial Cavity
The scalp is reflected, revealing a 3.5 cm subgaleal hematoma beneath the left temporal region. The calvarium is intact. The dura mater is free of hemorrhage. The brain weighs 1,420 grams and displays early signs of cerebral edema. No midline shift, uncal herniation, or hemorrhage is present. Circle of Willis is intact.

Neck Structures
The hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage are intact. No hemorrhage noted in strap muscles. Minor congestion of laryngeal mucosa. The trachea contains a thin film of frothy fluid, tan in color, non-odorous.

Thoracic Cavity
No rib fractures. Lungs are congested and edematous:

Right lung: 690 grams

Left lung: 670 grams
Both show frothy fluid on sectioning. No focal consolidation. Heart weighs 385 grams and displays concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Coronary arteries are patent with minimal atherosclerosis. No thrombus or dissection identified.

Abdominal Cavity
The liver weighs 1,750 grams and is slightly steatotic. Gallbladder contains 30 mL of bile, no stones.
Stomach contains approximately 200 mL of partially digested food, including visible fragments of carrot and red meat; no unusual odor or pill fragments noted.
Pancreas is unremarkable. Spleen weighs 160 grams and is congested.
Kidneys are symmetrical and without gross pathology. Bladder contains 130 mL of clear yellow urine.

Toxicology Specimens Collected
Central blood

Vitreous humor

Urine

Gastric contents

Liver tissue

Hair and nail samples

Microscopic Examination
Brain: Perivascular edema with mild gliosis; no neoplastic or infectious pathology.

Lungs: Alveolar edema with scattered macrophages. No hyaline membranes.

Heart: Mild myocyte hypertrophy, no infarction.

Liver: Macrovesicular steatosis affecting ~25% of hepatocytes.

Kidneys: Mild vacuolization of tubular epithelium.

Toxicology Report (Preliminary)
Ethanol: 0.06% BAC

Benzodiazepines: Positive (Midazolam detected in low therapeutic range)

Opioids: Negative

Illicit substances: Negative for cocaine, methamphetamines, THC

Other: Trace levels of acetaminophen; no toxic concentration detected

Ancillary Testing
DNA swabs: Collected from subungual beds, oral cavity, and ligature mark

Fingerprinting: Matches confirmed with government ID

Histology slides and digital photos: Archived in case file

Ligature Material: Found at scene; analysis pending

Opinion
Cause of Death: Asphyxia due to ligature strangulation
Manner of Death: Homicide
Time of Death Estimate: 36–48 hours prior to discovery (likely between 10:00 PM and 2:00 AM, July 23, 2025)
Contributing Factors: Minor blunt force trauma to the head, but not fatal; mild alcohol and benzodiazepine presence may have rendered the decedent less responsive.

Final Comments
This is a suspicious death consistent with manual or ligature strangulation. The presence of conjunctival petechiae, frothy pulmonary edema, and a ligature mark all support a diagnosis of asphyxia. The scene and toxicology do not suggest a natural or accidental event. Further investigation by law enforcement is recommended to determine the circumstances and identity of the assailant.
