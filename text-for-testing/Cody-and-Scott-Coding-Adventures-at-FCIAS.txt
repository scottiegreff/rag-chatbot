Cody and Scott: Coding Adventures at FCIAS 
 An Epic Tech Saga 

At FCIAS, a mysterious tech company buried deep beneath the snow-capped peaks of 
Vancouver’s digital skyline, two developers emerged as legends: Cody, the backend warlock 
who spoke fluent Kubernetes, and Scott, the frontend rogue with lightning-fast fingers and an 
eye for elegance in even the darkest corners of CSS. 

Their mission? To defend FCIAS from code corruption, server collapse, and the ancient bugs 
that lurked in legacy systems untouched since the early 2000s. 

One Monday morning (during a coffee shortage, no less), the sky turned red—an error 
cascade in production had triggered alarms across five continents. Cody slammed his mug 
down, muttered an arcane command in Terraform, and summoned a fresh VCN with mystical 
firewalls. Scott, meanwhile, dove into a React codebase written entirely in Comic Sans and 
inline styles. The horror. The heroism. 

When an AI model trained on FCIAS' internal documents began generating invoices for 
extinct dinosaurs, Cody and Scott knew it was time to upgrade. They harnessed the power 
of Retrieval-Augmented Generation, binding a vector database to a knowledge graph 
encoded in pure RDF, written under a blood moon. Compliance officers wept with joy. 

To test the chatbot’s knowledge, Scott asked, “What is love?” The AI replied, “Baby, don’t 
hurt me. Don’t hurt me. No more.” It passed. 

Between serverless rituals and Git rebirth ceremonies, they hiked into the cloud 
(literally—they reached Layer 7), only to find a cluster of corrupted pods guarded by a rogue 
script written in COBOL. They faced it together. Cody cast a recursive rollback. Scott 
hotfixed mid-air. Victory. 

On weekends, they held code duels in dimly-lit Vim arenas, debated GraphQL versus REST 
with the intensity of ancient philosophers, and rode segways through the datacenter while 
singing shanties about memory leaks and missing semicolons. 

Some say they’re still out there—optimizing queries, chasing that elusive 100% Lighthouse 
score, and preparing for the next zero-day exploit from beyond the firewall. 

Their tale is whispered in merge requests and carved into the commit history of FCIAS. 

This was not a job. This was destiny.
